It's a simple widget that shows your github projects. It uses the javascript from [Dr. Nic](http://drnicwilliams.com/)

== Description ==
It's a simple widget that lists your draft posts. It's got one configurable option: the number of drafts to show. 
If it's set to < 1 it will show all the drafts. It's using the widget api, so I should integrate with your theme without any problems.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the `github-widget.php` file folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place the widget in your sidebar
4. Tweak the settings if necessary
